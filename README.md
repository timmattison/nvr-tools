# nvr-tools-open-source

I'm releasing some closed source, commercial NVR tools eventually. In the meantime I'm putting some of the code here as
open-source so people can see what I'm doing and how I'm doing it.

I'm going to start with UniFi Protect and then move on to other NVRs if there's any interest.

The library code and tools here will be fairly bare bones. The commercial tools will have more features, GUI/TUI, etc.
